Sentiment Analysis with VADER and NLTK
This project demonstrates a simple sentiment analysis workflow using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and nltk. The core of the sentiment analysis is performed using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) lexicon from NLTK.

How to Import and Run the Notebook
This notebook can be run in two popular environments: Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab.

## Running in Jupyter Notebook
Installation: Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required Python libraries by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk

Download the Notebook: Save the 1_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb file to your local machine.

Launch Jupyter: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the notebook. Start Jupyter Notebook by running:

jupyter notebook

Open the Notebook: A browser window will open. Click on the 1_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb file to open it.

Run the Cells: You can run each code cell individually by clicking the "Run" button or by pressing Shift + Enter. Alternatively, you can run all cells by selecting "Cell" from the menu bar and then "Run All."

## Running in Google Colab
Open Google Colab: Go to https://colab.research.google.com/.

Upload the Notebook: In the top-left corner, click "File" and then "Upload Notebook."

Select the File: Choose the 1_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb file from your local machine and upload it.

Run the Cells: Once the notebook is loaded, you can run the code cells. Google Colab will automatically handle the installation of the necessary libraries when you run the first code cell that contains the nltk.download() commands.
